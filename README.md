# Clinical Trial Inspector Agent 🕵️‍♂️💊

**Clinical Trial Inspector** is an advanced AI agent designed to revolutionize how researchers, clinicians, and analysts explore clinical trial data. By combining **Semantic Search**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Visual Analytics**, it transforms raw data from [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) into actionable insights.

Built with **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex**, **Streamlit**, **Altair**, **Streamlit-Agraph**, and **Google Gemini**, this tool goes beyond simple keyword search. It understands natural language, generates inline visualizations, performs complex multi-dimensional analysis, and visualizes relationships in an interactive knowledge graph.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Search & RAG
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask complex questions like *"Find Phase 3 Pfizer studies for diabetes started after 2022"* or *"What are the inclusion criteria for recent Moderna trials?"*.
- **Semantic Understanding**: Powered by **PubMedBERT** embeddings (`pritamdeka/S-PubMedBert-MS-MARCO`) to understand medical context better than keyword matching.
- **Advanced Retrieval**:
    - **Query Expansion**: Automatically expands queries with medical synonyms (e.g., "cancer" -> "carcinoma", "tumor") using the LLM.
    - **Hybrid Search**: Combines semantic vector search with keyword boosting (BM25-style) for exact matches in titles/IDs.
    - **Re-Ranking**: Uses a Cross-Encoder (`ms-marco-MiniLM`) to re-score results for maximum relevance.
- **Query Decomposition**: Breaks down complex multi-part questions (e.g., *"Compare the primary outcomes of Keytruda vs Opdivo"*) into sub-questions for precise answers.

### 📊 Visual Analytics & Insights
- **Inline Charts (Contextual)**: The agent automatically generates **Bar Charts** and **Line Charts** directly in the chat stream when you ask aggregation questions (e.g., *"Top sponsors for Multiple Myeloma"*).
- **Analytics Dashboard (Global)**: A dedicated dashboard to analyze trends across the **entire dataset** (60,000+ studies), independent of your chat session.
- **Interactive Knowledge Graph**: Visualize connections between **Studies**, **Sponsors**, and **Conditions** in a dynamic, interactive network graph.

### 🔍 Multi-Filter Analysis
- **Complex Filtering**: Answer sophisticated questions by applying multiple filters simultaneously.
    - *Example*: *"For **Phase 2 and 3** studies, what are **Pfizer's** most common study indications?"*
- **Full Dataset Scope**: General analytics questions analyze the **entire database**, not just a sample.
- **Smart Retrieval**: Retrieves up to **5,000 relevant studies** for comprehensive analysis.

### ⚡ High-Performance Ingestion
- **Parallel Processing**: Uses multi-core processing to ingest and embed thousands of studies per minute.
- **Idempotent Updates**: Smartly updates existing records without duplication, allowing for seamless data refreshes.

## 🤖 Agent Capabilities & Tools

The agent is equipped with specialized tools to handle different types of requests:

### 1. `search_trials`
*   **Purpose**: Finds specific clinical trials based on natural language queries.
*   **Capabilities**: Semantic Search, Smart Filtering (Phase, Status, Sponsor, Intervention), Query Expansion, Hybrid Search, Re-Ranking.

### 2. `get_study_analytics`
*   **Purpose**: Aggregates data to reveal trends and insights.
*   **Capabilities**: Multi-Filtering, Grouping (Phase, Status, Sponsor, Year, Condition), Full Dataset Access, Inline Visualization.

### 3. `compare_studies`
*   **Purpose**: Handles complex comparison or multi-part questions.
*   **Capabilities**: Uses **Query Decomposition** to break a complex query into sub-queries, executes them against the database, and synthesizes the results.

### 4. `find_similar_studies`
*   **Purpose**: Discovers studies that are semantically similar to a specific trial.
*   **Capabilities**: Vector Similarity Search for "more like this" discovery.

## ⚙️ How It Works (RAG Pipeline)

1.  **Ingestion**: `ingest_ct.py` fetches study data from ClinicalTrials.gov. It creates a rich text representation and extracts structured metadata. It uses **multiprocessing** for speed.
2.  **Embedding**: Text is converted into vector embeddings using `PubMedBERT` and stored in **ChromaDB**.
3.  **Retrieval**:
    *   **Query Transformation**: Synonyms are injected via LLM.
    *   **Hybrid Search**: Vector search + Keyword Boosting.
    *   **Filtering**: Pre-retrieval (Status, Year) and Post-retrieval (Phase, Sponsor, Intervention) filters.
    *   **Re-Ranking**: Cross-Encoder re-scoring.
4.  **Synthesis**: **Google Gemini** synthesizes the final answer.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A Google Cloud API Key with access to Gemini

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd clinical_trial_agent
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google API Key:
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

## 📖 Usage

### 1. Ingest Data
Populate the local database. The script uses parallel processing for speed.

```bash
# Recommended: Ingest 5000 recent studies
python scripts/ingest_ct.py --limit 5000 --years 5

# Ingest ALL studies (Warning: Large download!)
python scripts/ingest_ct.py --limit -1
```

### 2. Run the Agent
Launch the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run ct_agent_app.py
```

### 3. Ask Questions!
- **Search**: *"Find recruiting studies for Alzheimer's in the US."*
- **Comparison**: *"Compare the primary outcomes of Keytruda vs Opdivo."*
- **Analytics**: *"Who are the top sponsors for Breast Cancer?"*
- **Graph**: Go to the **Knowledge Graph** tab to visualize connections.
